The interaction of hydrodynamic resolution and sea lice behaviour on dispersal dynamics


Lagrangian particle tracking simulations are extensively used to predict the dynamics of the planktonic stages of sea lice, with particular emphasis on transmission from and between salmon aquaculture farms. These models have incorporated much biological complexity, including temperature-dependent growth, salinity-dependent mortality, phototactic swimming, and avoidance of low salinity and high turbulence. However, the simulations at their core rely on hydrodynamic models, and no degree of sophistication of the biological model will overcome a mismatch between real-world hydrodynamics and those used in the model.

Here, we assess the impact of hydrodynamic model resolution on predicted sea lice dynamics. We evaluate the interaction between temporal and spatial resolution of the hydrodynamic model with the uncertainty and variability in lice sinking and swimming behaviours. We simulate lice dynamics in Loch Linnhe, a well-studied sea water loch in western Scotland with developed salmon aquaculture, as well as topographical features that generate dramatic depth-dependent tidal variation in salinity, temperature, and velocity.
